Experiment: piggy.go

Write a new piggy bank program that uses integers to track the number of cents rather than dollars. Randomly place nickels (5¢), dimes (10¢), and quarters (25¢) into an empty piggy bank until it contains at least $20.

Display the running balance of the piggy bank after each deposit in dollars (for example, $1.05).
