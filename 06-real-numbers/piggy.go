Experiment: piggy.go

Save some money to buy a gift for your friend. Write a program that randomly places nickels ($0.05), dimes ($0.10), and quarters ($0.25) into an empty piggy bank until it contains at least $20.00. Display the running balance of the piggy bank after each deposit, formatting it with an appropriate width and precision.
